Submitted: Ganbare-Lucifer
Code: IMX, Ganbare-Lucifer
GLDEFs: Ganbare-Lucifer
Sounds: Lobotomy Software, IMX, Ganbare-Lucifer
Sprites: id Software, 3D Realms and Lobotomy Software. Gibs by Enjay and Fuzzballfox
Sprite Edit: IMX, Ganbare-Lucifer
Idea Base: The original Black Panther by IMX, along with the Shadow Warrior prototype sprites, decided to modify them into an entity that morphs into another after death so it looks less like a quick Hell Knight edit.

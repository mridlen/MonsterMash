This is allegedly a GPL-3 license on GZDoom, which is where I copied these actor definitions:

https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/

I have left these files as intact as possible, I just need them for reference to resolve inheritance. Some might end up being disabled, removed, or formatted slightly, but only to make it work with this script.

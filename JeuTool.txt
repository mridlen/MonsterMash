About
-----

Pronounced: *Zhur-Tool*

JeuTool is a command-line tool for packing and unpacking WAD files.
The concept is similar to DeuTex, but JeuTool works quite differently.
For example, it does not require a "wadinfo" file to describe the
contents of a WAD to build, instead the lumps are just found by
scanning the filesystem.

JeuTool User Manual
===================

by Andrew Apted, 2018.


Overview
--------

JeuTool is a command-line utility whose primary purpose is to
compose and decompose DOOM wad files.  You need to run it from a
terminal or shell window, though it can be used in scripts too
(e.g. in a BAT file).

JeuTool supports wad files for DOOM, DOOM II, FreeDoom, Heretic,
Hexen and Strife, plus some lesser-known games using the DOOM
engine, like Chex Quest and HacX.  It can pack and unpack wads
for the game itself (IWADs) and user-created wads (PWADs).

The first argument given to JeuTool is a *command name*, such
as `extract` to extract the contents of a wad file.  The --help
option will show a brief help screen showing a summary of the
available commands and options.  The commands are described in
detail in the 'Command List' section below.


Output Messages
---------------

The output messages fall into four broad categories, each with
a distinct color:

- white for general progress messages
- brown for warning messages
- red for failure/error messages
- light blue for verbose messages

Failure messages are prefixed by `ERROR:` and are used to
indicate that something which would normally work failed for
some reason.  Any lump that failed to be extracted and any
recognised file that failed to be imported will be reported
with a failure message.

Warning messages are prefixed by `Warning:` and indicate that
there may be a problem with something.  For example: if an
imported text file seems to be binary then a warning is shown,
because when the wad is unpacked in the future that lump will
get exported as a *raw file* and not as a text file.  A common
source of warnings occurs when building a wad and one of the
files has an unrecognised file type.

At the end of extracting or building a wad, a colored one-line
summary is displayed.  This is green if there were no failures,
and bright red otherwise.  If there were some failures and/or
some warnings, the total count will also be shown.


Exit Codes
----------

- 0 if OK (though there may have been warnings).
- 1 if unknown command, could not parse arguments, need a palette, etc.
- 2 if a failure occurred while building or extracting a wad.


Command List
------------

`info  FILE ...`  
The info command takes one or more wad filenames as arguments,
and displays some brief information about them.  It can tell you
whether the wad is a PWAD or an IWAD, and how many lumps (entries)
it contains.  When it cannot open the file, or the file is not a
valid wad file, then an appropriate message is shown instead.

Example:

    $ jeutool info heretic.wad cchest4.wad /foo.wad
    heretic.wad : IWAD with 2633 lumps
    cchest4.wad : PWAD with 2680 lumps
    foo.wad     : open /foo.wad: no such file or directory


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

`list  FILE`  
The list command takes a wad filename argument, and displays a
listing of the wad's contents to the standard output (stdout).
The listing shows the lump index, the lump name, the size of
the lump (in bytes), the position of the lump in the file, and
what format JeuTool considers the lump to be.  When the format
cannot be determined, it is shown as "????".

Example:

    $ jeutool list xa-goril.wad
       0:  DEHACKED      210  at 0x0000000c  Text lump

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

`pipe  FILE  LUMP`  
The pipe command takes a wad file and a lump name, and outputs
the *raw contents* of that lump to the standard output (stdout).
You will usually want to redirect the output, e.g. using `>` to
store the contents into another file, or using `|` to pipe the
contents into another program.

Since the lump contents are sent to standard output, there are
no messages shown when using this command, although errors like
"file not found" still get displayed on standard error (stderr).

The lump name can be uppercase or lowercase, or even a mixture
of the two, and it will be found in the wad if it exists.  When
the wad contains multiple lumps with the same name, then the
*first one* (i.e. with the lowest index) is used.

Example of saving a lump:

    $ jeutool pipe doom2.wad COLORMAP > COLORMAP.raw

Example of reading a text lump:

    $ jeutool pipe freedoom2.wad dehacked | more


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

`extract  FILE  [DIR]`  
The extract command extracts the contents of a wad into a fresh
directory.  The directory name is optional, when absent it will be
deduced by removing ".wad" from the wad filename.  If the directory
cannot be created, e.g. because it already exists, then an error
message is shown.

Most user-made wads do not contain a palette.  You will need to
tell JeuTool what palette to use, otherwise the following error
will be shown:

    jeutool: no PLAYPAL found in wad (use --pal option)

There are several ways to specify a palette, including using one
of the built-in ones.  See the'Option List' section below for more
information on the --pal option.

Example:

    $ jeutool extract xa-goril.wad -p doom

     )|(  JeuTool 0.5.7  (C) 2018 Andrew Apted, et al  )|(

    Closing WAD file

    Ok, all good.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

`build  FILE  [DIR]`  
The build command constructs a wad file using the contents of a
directory, such as one previously extracted by JeuTool.
The directory name is optional, when absent it will be deduced from
the wad filename by removing the ".wad" extension.  When the wad
file already exists, it will be silently overwritten by the newly
composed wad file -- so take care!

Example:

    $ jeutool build xa-goril2.wad xa-goril

    Ok, all good.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Option List
-----------

`-p  --pal   FILE`  
Specifies which palette to use for image conversions.  The FILE
argument is either a file to load the palette from, or the name
of a built-in palette.  For files, the format may be a WAD file
(typically an IWAD) containing a PLAYPAL lump, or a PNG image,
or a text file using the same format as "base-pal.txt", or it can
be a ".raw" file containing at least 768 bytes (256 RGB triples).

This option is only needed when the palette cannot be determined
any other way, mainly when using the extract command on a PWAD.
When the wad contains a PLAYPAL lump (including when building)
then that is always used and this option is ignored.

The built-in palettes are: doom, heretic, hexen, strife.

`-l  --lower`  
Causes the extract command to use lowercase filenames for the
extracted lumps.  The default is to use uppercase for the lump
name but a lowercase extension, like this: "COLORMAP.png"

Note that the build command does not need this option, the files
in the input directory are found regardless of their case, and
are inserted into the output wad as uppercase lump names
(which is the normal convention for wad files).

`-r  --raw`  
Causes the extract command to save every lump as-is (without any
conversion).  The saved files will have the ".raw" extension.
Maps in the wad are broken apart and their lumps are saved into
a sub-directory having the name of the map.

Note that the build command does not need this option, as it
automatically handles ".raw" files, inserting them into the
output wad as-is (without conversion).  It can also reconstruct
maps from their raw components.

`-v  --verbose`  
Produces more verbose output.  In particular, a message will be
shown for every lump which is extracted from a source wad or
added to a destination wad.

`-n  --nocolor`  
Disables the use of colorized output.  Note that color output
is automatically disabled when the standard output is not a
terminal, e.g. when piping the output through a pager program
like "more" or into a file.

`-h  --help`  
Displays a brief help screen, then exits.

`--version`  
Displays a version number and date, then exits.


File Formats
------------

One of JeuTool's primary responsibilities is to convert the lumps
in a wad file to/from a more generally useful format.  For example,
audio editing software cannot use the raw sound format which DOOM
uses, hence DOOM sounds are extracted as WAV files, and WAV files
are converted back to DOOM sounds when building a wad.

However, modern source ports generally accept a wide range of file
formats stored directly in a lump (without any conversion), and
JeuTool aims to accommodate such usage as well.  This poses a
dilemma though: when should a file be imported directly and when
should it be converted?

JeuTool solves this dilemma as follows: generally files which are
PNG images and WAV sounds will be converted to/from the normal
DOOM formats, and most other file types are *not converted*.
However, PNG and WAV files *can be* imported as-is, without
conversion, by prefixing their filename with an `=` character.

Some examples:

    graphics/TITLEPIC.png  --> converted to DOOM patch
    graphics/=INTERPIC.png --> stored as-is (PNG format)

    sounds/DSPISTOL.wav  --> converted to DMX audio
    sounds/=DSBAREXP.wav --> stored as-is (WAV format)

Note that files in the `special/` directory are an exception, and
are nearly always converted.  Hence the `=` prefix cannot be used
there, as it makes no sense to import the PLAYPAL or COLORMAP
lumps (etc) as a true PNG image.

Also note that files with the ".raw" extension are *always*
imported as-is when building a wad.  Use this as a last resort
if you ever need to import a file type which JeuTool does not
recognise.


Images with Offsets
-------------------

Some graphics in a DOOM wad file contain X and Y offset values
which are needed ti draw them properly.  This is especially true
for sprites, which need the X offset to be roughly half the
image width, and the Y offset to be roughly equal to the image
height.  A common technique is using a Y offset higher than the
image height, making the sprite look like it is floating in the
air.  Having wrong offsets will make a sprite look very odd when
playing the game.

Since PNG images contain no mechanism to supply X/Y offsets,
JeuTool allows them to be supplied *in the filename*.  This is
done by appending the lump name with a comma, the X value, another
comma, and then the Y value.

Some examples:

    sprites/HEADA1,31,67.png   --> X is 31, Y is 67
    graphics/STTMINUS,0,-5.png --> X is 0,  Y is -5

Negative values are sometimes used, especially for weapons drawn
from the player's POV.  These images use X and Y values that are
relative to the top-left of a 320x200 pixel screen, except that
the values are negated (e.g. more negative X values push the
on-screen image further to the right).

Offset values are only usable on PNG images which get converted
to the DOOM patch format.  The offsets are not allowed on PNG
images which are imported directly (as-is) using the `=` prefix,
or with any other type of image format.

There is a source port feature which allows storing X/Y offsets
*inside* the PNG image itself.  This is achieved using a custom
chunk called "grAb".  JeuTool does not support this feature in
any way.


Directory Layout
----------------

This section gives some information about the layout of files and
directories after extracting a wad.

One principle is that when a directory is used in a ZDoom PK3 or
Eternity PKE package, then JeuTool generally uses the same name.
For example, maps (levels) from a wad are stored in the `maps/`
directory.  This is in contrast to DeuTex which uses `levels/`
for the same purpose.

Another principle is that every "namespace" inside a wad file
corresponds to a distinct directory created or scanned by JeuTool.
For example, everything in the `sprites/` directory will occur
between **SS_START..SS_END** markers, which is the normal convention
for sprites in user wads.  On the other hand, there are several
directories used by JeuTool which do not correspond to any wad
namespace, such as the `unknown/` directory.


Files
-----

`config.cfg`  
This file contains some miscellaneous configuration values for the
wad being built or extracted.  The most important one is whether or
not the wad is an IWAD or a PWAD.  This config file can be absent,
in which case the default is to build a PWAD.

`base-pal.txt`  
This file remembers the base palette (256 RGB colors) used when
extracting all the graphics, sprites, patches (etc) from a wad.
The primary purpose is to allow rebuilding the wad without having
to specify the palette again (via --pal option).  This file is
optional.


Directories
-----------

`defs/`  
This directory is where plain text files are stored.  Such files
are generally used for human-readable definitions, hence the name.
This is where lumps like DEHACKED, MAPINFO, or DECORATE will be
extracted to.

`unknown/`  
This is where lumps are extracted to when JeuTool could not recognise
their format.  The files placed here are always raw binary files with
the ".raw" extension, and when building they are always added as-is
(without conversion).  Be sure to look in this directory when you
think a lump has gone missing.

`special/`  
This directory is used for lumps which require special handling or
don't fit neatly into any other category.  That includes images which
are stored as a raw block of pixels in the game's palette, like the
TITLE screen of Heretic and Hexen, which can only be detected by
their size (e.g. 320*200) or their name (e.g. STRTBOT).

Notable files in this directory:
- `PLAYPAL.png` is a set of 256-color palettes
- `COLORMAP.png` is a color mapping used to control lighting
- `GENMIDI.raw` contains instrument data for FM synthesis (OPL2 chip)
- `TEXTURE1.txt` specifies how textures are composed from a set of patches
- `ENDOOM.ans` is a VGA text screen, converted to ANSI escape sequences
- `SNDCURVE.csv` is Heretic and Hexen's sound attentuation table
- `STARTUP.png` is Hexen's 640x480 16-color startup screen
- `XLATAB.png` is Strifes's 256x256 translucency mapping table

`maps/`  
Maps (levels) are stored here.  Except in --raw mode, the maps are
kept in their own little wad file, since map lumps depend on each
other and it is pointless to break them apart, plus every DOOM editor
requires maps to be in a wad.  When importing a map, the map name is
taken from the filename, and the name inside the wad is ignored.
It is an error for the wad to contain no maps or multiple maps.

`demos/`  
This directory contain demo lumps.  These files use the ".lmp"
extension, which is the usual convention for DOOM demos.  They
are a raw binary format which are extracted and imported as-is.

`sounds/`  
`voices/`  
These directories are where sound files are stored.
The voices directory is only used by the game Strife.
The original games use a formal called "DMX audio" for sound lumps,
and JeuTool will converted between this format and WAV files when
extracting or building.

Some source ports allow using WAV files directly, and this can be
achieved by prefixing the filename with an `=` character.  Other
audio formats, such as VOC and OGG, may also be supported by some
engines, and these can be imported as-is (no prefix is necessary).

Note that JeuTool cannot detect when a lump in MP3 or OGG/Vorbis
format is supposed to be music or a sound effect, so currently
all such files will be extracted into the music/ directory.

`pcsfx/`  
This directory is where PC-speaker sound effects are stored.
The format used for these is a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file,
which can be read and edited as plain text.  Each line, except the
header, is a number representing the tone (frequency) to play for
a small time interval (1/140th second).

`music/`  
Here is where music files are placed.  The original games used a
custom music format called "DMX music" or simply "MUS", with the
file extension ".mus".  It was also discovered that MIDI music
can also be used directly in a lump.

Modern source ports allow even more formats, including compressed
audio formats like MP3 and OGG/Vorbis, and also module based music.
These can also be imported and extracted by JeuTool.

Note that JeuTool currently cannot detect when a lump contains a
type of module music, such as files created by Scream Tracker or
Impulse Tracker.  When building, files with ".mod", ".s3m", ".it"
and ".xm" extensions will be imported, but when extracted they end
up in the unknown/ directory.

`graphics/`  
This directory contains all the miscellaneous graphics used by the
DOOM engine, such as title screens, menu graphics, the red font,
status bar graphics, etc...  Most lumps which are detected to be
an image format but are not inside any wad namespace will end up
in this directory.

Graphics in the original games where mostly in the "DOOM patch"
format.  However modern source ports generally allow a wide range
of other formats, like PNG, GIF and TGA.  To import a PNG file as-is
(with no conversion), prefix the filename with an `=` character.
For other formats, just place them normally (no prefix is needed).

`hires/`  
Hires graphics replacements are a feature of ZDoom.  Each image in
this directory is meant to replace an existing texture, graphic, sprite
(etc) to provide a higher resolution version of it.  This directory
corresponds to the **HI_START..HI_END** namespace in a wad file.

`textures/`  
This directory corresponds to the **TX_START..TX_END** wad namespace,
and is a feature originally appearing in ZDoom, but now supported by
other source ports.  Images in this directory are used directly as
textures, which is a much simpler way of adding textures than via
the TEXTURE1 and TEXTURE2 lumps.

PNG images are commonly used here (as well as DOOM patch format),
and these can be imported directly by prefixing the filename with
an `=` character.

Note that the DeuTex program also uses a textures/ directory, but for
a very different purpose: to store the TEXTURE1 and TEXTURE2 lumps
(converted into text files).

`sprites/`  
This directory corresponds to the **S_START..S_END** wad namespace,
and contains all the sprites for the game, such as monsters, pickup
items, decorations, fireballs, as well as the player's weapons as
seen from the first-person POV.

Sprite images need proper X/Y offsets to be positioned correctly on
the screen.  With JeuTool, these offsets become part of the filename
using a ",XXX,YYY" suffix.  See the 'Images with Offsets' section
above for more details.

`flats/`  
This directory corresponds to the **F_START..F_END** namespace in a
wad, and contains the textures used on flat surfaces (floors and
ceilings) in a map.  Within a wad, flats are just a raw block of
pixels, with no information to determine their size, hence JeuTool
needs to guess the image size.  For DOOM, all flats were 64x64, but
later games used 64x65 and 64x128 for scrolling flats, and some
source ports support high-resolution flats (e.g. 128x128 pixels).

`patches/`  
Patches in this context refers to images which are used to compose
textures, i.e. each texture consists of one or more patches which are
merged to form a whole texture.  This directory is used to contain
these patches, and corresponds to the **P_START..P_END** namespace.
Although the DOOM engine does not require patch images to exist in
this namespace, it is still handy to have them separated from all
the other graphics.

Patch lumps, like most other DOOM graphics, are in the DOOM patch
format, and PNG files in this directory will normally be converted
between PNG format and DOOM patch format.

`font_a/`  
`font_ay/`  
`font_b/`  
These directories contain the font graphics used by Heretic and Hexen.
It should contain the full set of characters, e.g. FONTA01 to FONTA59,
otherwise the engine may crash or show garbage on the screen.

`colormaps/`  
This directory corresponds to the **C_START..C_END** namespace in a
wad, and contains colormaps which can be used within levels to provide
a custom visual effect in a sector (e.g. blue water of gray fog).
This is a feature introduced by the BOOM source port.

Colormaps are extracted and imported as PNG images, generally with
256 colors in each row, and 34 rows (one for each light level, plus
one for the invulnerability effect, and one unused).

Note that other colormaps, such as the standard COLORMAP lump,
*should not* be placed in this directory, nor should other things
like font translation tables, otherwise the engine may fail to find
them.

`translations/`  
This directory is a feature of the Eternity source port, and
contains color translation tables used to remap the colors of
certain sprites, e.g. the player sprite in multiplayer games.
This directory corresponds to the **T_START..T_END** namespace
in a wad.

Translation tables are extracted and imported as PNG images,
generally with 256 colors in each row, but when there are only
256 colors in total, a size of 16x16 pixels is used instead.

Note that other types of translation tables, e.g. for recoloring
fonts, should *not* be placed in this directory.

`dialogs/`  
Here is where Strife's dialog lumps are placed.  These have a name
like SCRIPT12, and correspond to a map with the same number (MAP12
in this case).  The format is binary, the raw output of a Strife
dialog compiler, and the files use the ".o" extension.

The ZDoom port also supports text (a.k.a. "uncompiled") versions
of these dialog files.  These are also stored here, and have names
with the "DIALOG" prefix and use the ".txt" file extension.

`acs/`  
This directory is a ZDoom feature and it contains compiled libraries
for ACS scripting.  It corresponds to the **A_START..A_END** namespace
within a wad file.  The files are the raw output of the ACS compiler,
ACC, and should have the ".o" file extension.

`voxels/`  
Voxels are another ZDoom feature, and this directory is used for
voxel models.  It corresponds to the **VX_START..VX_END** wad
namespace.  The files are assumed to be the KVX format (as far as
I am aware, ZDoom does not support any other voxel formats), and
only files with the ".kvx" extension will be imported.

`models/`  
This directory contains 3D models, which can be used by some
modern source ports.  The file extensions ".mdl", ".md2", ".md3",
".dmd", ".3d" and ".obj" are accepted when building, but note that
the last two cannot be detected by JeuTool inside a lump, and hence
they are currently extracted into another directory.
